# Security Policy

## Supported versions

LingoFlow is a static, client-side app. Thereâ€™s no backend. Security issues are typically related to dependencies in optional dev tooling or unsafe CSV handling.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a private security advisory on GitHub or email the maintainer (see repo). Please include steps to reproduce and the affected browser/OS. We will investigate and respond promptly.
